# groceries-attempt
I'm having some issues following your walk through as I'm on a mac - I started coding in the command line (i followed the code you have for creating folders) but ran into trouble when I had to use the conda command. I tried to recode everything in anaconda prompt but now i'm having issues with working with the groceries-env AND activating python AND reading the groceries.py file. please let me know if you can see where I've gone wrong.
